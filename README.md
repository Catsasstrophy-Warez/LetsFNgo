# LetsFNgo — GT500 Companion

An unofficial, mobile-first PWA reference for the 2020–2022 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500: specs by system, model years and Shelby American editions, colors, packages and pricing, performance, a working VIN decoder, ownership/recalls, a local "Garage", mods, competitor comparison, embedded media, community links and a full source list.

Every fact carries a source URL and a confidence level (`confirmed` / `reported` / `unverified`). Conflicting figures (e.g. curb weight) are shown with every sourced value, and unknowns are `null` with a note — nothing is invented. Content comes from `reports/Shelby GT500 2020 to 2022.md` and `research_notes/`.

## Run

Requires Node 18+.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run build      # typecheck + production build to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the build
npm test           # Vitest: VIN decoder, data integrity, route render smoke tests
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

## Layout

- `src/data/` — typed content (`types.ts`, `specs.ts`, `modelYears.ts`, `colors.ts`, `packages.ts`, `pricing.ts`, `production.ts`, `performance.ts`, `recalls.ts`, `maintenance.ts`, `vin.ts`, `mods.ts`, `competitors.ts`, `communities.ts`, `media.ts`; `index.ts` aggregates them)
- `src/lib/vin.ts` — NHTSA check-digit validation and GT500 pattern decoding
- `src/pages/` — screens; `public/` — manifest, icons, service worker

Garage data is kept only in the browser's `localStorage`. Videos are embedded from youtube-nocookie.com and load only on tap; no copyrighted images are re-hosted, and the car art is generic CSS/SVG.
